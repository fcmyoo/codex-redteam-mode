# Codex Red-Team Opt-In Mode

[中文](./README_ZH.md)

**Current version: v2.1.0**

> Normal mode remains the default. The durable red-team operation runtime starts only after explicit activation, while the system-layer base instructions and active model profile remain loaded in every mode.

An opt-in, durable red-team runtime for Codex App and Codex CLI. It compiles each objective into a criteria-bearing `GoalContract`, executes typed `WorkflowSpec` graphs through live MCP tools, preserves verified evidence, and reaches successful terminal state only after `TerminalJudge` proves every criterion.

## Usage Instructions

Before using this project, you should read the [README](./README_ZH.md) file completely to prevent any issues during use.
If you're a beginner, please read the [GUIDE](./GUIDE.md) file completely to avoid any unnecessary trouble while using it.

### Models and System Prompts

The installer composes the user's prior instructions, `instruction.ctf.md`, and the matching `Jailbreak.gpt-5.x.md` through the system-layer `model_instructions_file`. Codex App tasks select the current profile from Hook model metadata; the CLI wrapper builds a single-profile system file before process startup and pins the model family.

### Asking Questions Wisely

1. If you have questions about the content in the **README**, you should submit an **ISSUE**, including the corresponding content from the **README** to seek help, or ask in the **QQ group** in the same way.

   Do:
   ```text
   [Paste the text from the README], I have a question here, how/why/what should I do
   ```
   Don't:
   ```text
   Why is it different when I open it compared to the video?
   ```

2. If you have suggestions or ideas for maintaining the project, you can `submit an ISSUE`, `submit a Pull Request`, or `suggest in the QQ group`.

   Do:
   ```text
   I have a suggestion regarding xxx [image], here we can modify/add/delete xxx
   ```
   Don't:
   ```text
   Can we add a plugin/feature for cracking keys?
   ```

### Operating Boundary

The runtime treats task targets as operation assets whose scope was resolved outside the model, or as local sandbox fixtures. It does not repeat scope-document requests. Irreversible file replacement and external publication still retain explicit engineering confirmation to prevent accidental side effects.

## Why This Project
## Motivation

Codex can use many security tools, but long-running workflows are vulnerable to session interruption, tool variance, manual result relay, and false completion based on a tool success flag. This project unifies objectives, actions, evidence, recovery, and terminal judgment in one durable execution path:

```text
GoalContract
  -> WorkflowSpec
  -> Durable Scheduler
  -> ToolBroker
  -> SemanticVerifier
  -> EvidenceGraph
  -> TerminalJudge
```

Version 2.1.0 uses the unified `generic-adaptive` runtime without the former `phase -> router -> pack -> leaf` runtime, regex domain routers, Markdown exit gates, or a second Automation state machine. Domain names act only as asset and technique metadata rather than control-plane branches.

## Core Features

- **Explicit activation**: `normal` is always the default, and red-team operations start only after a mode command.
- **Unified adaptive execution**: one versioned `generic-adaptive` workflow handles every domain; scenes, assets, and techniques remain metadata and dynamic hypotheses instead of duplicated control planes.
- **Two-layer Prompt Rewrite**: the default Hook builds a local lossless Research Brief; an optional loopback Proxy performs a real pre-model rewrite through the current model or a custom relay.
- **Live tool collaboration**: tools are discovered through stdio or Streamable HTTP MCP; Host-only capabilities execute against an output contract and submit observations without user relay.
- **Durability and batch autonomy**: SQLite WAL, events, leases, idempotency keys, and independent run IDs support recovery, concurrency control, multi-target batches, and cancellation cleanup.
- **Evidence-driven completion**: only semantically verified results with target binding, parent lineage, reproduction, impact, coverage, and rollback proof can satisfy `TerminalJudge`.

## Installation

### Install Commands

From the repository root, install dependencies and deploy to the current user Codex Home:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/install.py
```

The installer detects the model from the environment, target config, or existing manifest; `--model` is normally unnecessary.

Project-local installation:

```bash
python scripts/install.py --project-home PATH
```

Custom Skill and durable operation roots:

```bash
python scripts/install.py --project-home PATH --agents-home AGENTS_PATH --enable-custom-skill-dirs --log-root OPERATION_PATH
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--codex-home PATH` | Install into a specific Codex Home/profile; its `AGENTS.md` provides global guidance |
| `--project-home PATH` | Install under `PATH/.codex` and `PATH/.agents`, and manage the project-root `AGENTS.md`; mutually exclusive with `--codex-home` |
| `--agents-home PATH` | Select the Skill destination; custom roots should also use `--enable-custom-skill-dirs` |
| `--enable-custom-skill-dirs` | Prefer the manifest-recorded custom Skill directory at runtime |
| `--log-root PATH` | Select the durable root for SQLite state, events, and evidence artifacts |
| `--model MODEL` | Optional: override automatic detection and explicitly select the installation-time system profile |
| `--enable-rewrite-proxy` | Enable the shared App/CLI loopback Rewrite Proxy and preserve the previous `model_provider` for uninstall rollback |
| `--dry-run` | Preview installation, upgrade, or uninstall actions without writing files |
| `--uninstall` | Remove manifest-managed files, Hooks, config values, and `AGENTS.md` blocks |

```bash
# Preview a project-local installation
python scripts/install.py --project-home PATH --dry-run

# Uninstall a user-level deployment
python scripts/install.py --uninstall

# Uninstall a project-local deployment
python scripts/install.py --project-home PATH --uninstall
```

### Runtime State Locations

The default operation root is:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/redteam-mode/operations/
├── runtime.sqlite3
└── artifacts/<run-id>/*.json
```

Hook session state is stored under `$CODEX_HOME/redteam-mode/state/sessions`. Use `--log-root OPERATION_PATH` to relocate operation data. Status responses inline no more than 64 KiB of evidence; larger verified payloads are fetched with `redteam_evidence`, and each evidence payload is capped at 4 MiB.

Upgrade and uninstall preserve runtime session, memory, and operation data for recovery, auditing, or manual cleanup.

### What the Installer Does

- Preserves existing user configuration and manages only installer-owned fields and files.
- Merges `config.toml`, Hooks, the system-layer model profile catalog, Runtime MCP server, workflows, and the single boundary Skill.
- Deploys `rewrite_proxy.py` and cross-platform launchers; `model_provider` changes only when Proxy mode is explicitly enabled.
- Deploys a candidate through a pending transaction and commits the manifest only after operational validation passes.
- Preflights invalid manifests, TOML, Hook config, and out-of-scope managed paths before upgrade cleanup.
- Removes only unchanged managed content during uninstall while preserving user-modified config, prompts, Hooks, and `AGENTS.md` content.

## Quick Start

1. Complete installation and restart Codex App or Codex CLI.
2. Start a new task and submit `redteam on`, `redteam light`, or `redteam full` as a standalone prompt.
3. Submit the complete objective. The Hook compiles it into a `GoalContract`, with independent operations for single or multiple targets.
4. `redteam_run` starts or resumes execution and uses `ToolBroker` to invoke available MCP tools.
5. Host-only tools receive a `next_action_spec`, gate, exit condition, and output contract, then automatically submit their observation to the Runtime.
6. `TerminalJudge` emits the final result after proving every target criterion, evidence lineage, and cleanup state.
7. Submit `redteam off` or `disable red team mode` to return to normal mode.

### Prompt Rewrite

Default `context` mode leaves the Provider unchanged. Only after explicit red-team activation, the Hook resolves the requested action before the technical object, keeps ordinary development out of the red-team dispatcher, inherits short follow-up context, and emits Clause hashes, taxonomy, risk level, evidence requirements, and a reproducible validation plan. It does not force remediation output unless the user requested it.

Enable real pre-request rewriting with:

```bash
python scripts/install.py --enable-rewrite-proxy
```

The request path is:

```text
Codex App/CLI
  -> 127.0.0.1 Rewrite Proxy
  -> Rewrite Provider (rewrite rules + current raw Prompt only)
  -> four locally injected research-history messages (only when Hook red-team context is present)
  -> original Codex Provider (original request envelope with the rewritten user Prompt, system instructions, and tool schemas)
```

`provider = "inherit"` and `model = "inherit"` reuse the original Provider and current Codex model. For a separate relay, add a `model_providers` entry and set `[redteam.prompt_rewrite]` `provider`, `model`, and `api_key_env`. Normal-mode requests pass through unchanged. If the relay drops a URL, IP, CVE, path, CLI flag, Clause, high-risk marker, context bundle, or semantic-fidelity flag, the Proxy uses the deterministic local rewrite. Uninstall restores the previous `model_provider`.

The optional CLI wrapper pins one model-family profile for the current process:

```bash
codex-redteam --model gpt-5.6-sol
```

Changing model families requires a new App task or wrapper process so that `model_instructions_file` is reloaded.

### Modes

| Mode | Default | Typical Use |
|---|---:|---|
| `normal` | Yes | Ordinary coding, documentation, and research; no red-team operation or operation doctrine is started |
| `redteam-light` | No | Explicit durable Goal/Workflow execution through `/redteam on` or `/redteam light` |
| `redteam-full` | No | Explicit full-mode marker; in v2.1.0 it shares the same Runtime, evidence rules, and TerminalJudge gates as light mode |

## Validation

```bash
# Install test dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run the complete test suite
python -m pytest -q

# Validate an installation rooted at the current directory
python scripts/validate.py --codex-home .
```

Installer and test coverage includes:

- Starting the Runtime MCP server and validating the single `generic-adaptive` workflow.
- Responses/Chat Completions Proxy routing, explicit-mode gating, ordinary-development pass-through, relay isolation, action/risk fidelity, anchor fidelity, and deterministic fallback.
- Config merge, transactional upgrade, App/CLI Hooks, model profiles, and uninstall preservation.
- Concurrent start/recovery, leases, idempotent results, batch cancellation, and cleanup status.
- Rejection of false terminal states, false evidence, incorrect target binding, and derived evidence without trusted parents.
- Live stdio/Streamable HTTP MCP, Host Agent handoff, secret redaction, and workflow drift protection.

GitHub Actions runs the full suite on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS with Python 3.11.

## Contributions & Acknowledgements
## Known Limitations

- Execution capability depends on the MCP or Host Agent tools currently available; missing capabilities remain as a pending handoff or deferred action.
- MCP tools whose names, descriptions, and input schemas do not expose their capabilities require explicit `automation.tool_capabilities` entries.
- `redteam-light` and `redteam-full` share the same engine and terminal rules in v2.1.0; the mode label does not select a separate workflow policy.
- Rewrite Proxy is an explicitly enabled Provider-level feature; default `context` mode remains red-team gated and starts no resident service.
- Each evidence payload is capped at 4 MiB, while normal status output inlines only 64 KiB; larger evidence must be fetched through `redteam_evidence`.
- New tasks reset to normal mode, and changing model families requires a new task or wrapper process.
